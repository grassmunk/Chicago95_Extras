# Extra Icons/Fonts for Chicago 95

## Icons

Unhappy with some of the icons used in the Chicago 95 icon pack? Or maybe there's an application yo use not included in the icon theme, but you don't want to use one of the available ones?

Have no fear, included in this pack are icons extract from the following sources:

- Adobe Acrobat
- cuteftp

- getright

The folders are broken down by application and further by type:

- cur: Custom cursors used by that application
- ico: Icons used by that application
- cur_png: PNG of the cursors
- ico_png: PNG of the icons

All images were extracted using Nirsoft Icon Extracter, icotools and wrestools.

simply copy the application icon you'd like to use to `/.icons/Chicago95/Apps/<size>` where `<size>` is the size of icon you selected. A little tip, try to use the icons labeled `_4` instead of `_8` to remaining consistent witht the theme.
